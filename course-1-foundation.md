### 💡 Personal Understanding
- This was just the beginning of the course, it is highly informative, it introduced to new terms about which i had no prior knowledge, it was brief and crisp, i was able to score 88.88% in the module 1 assignment on my first attempt and then 94.44% on my second attempt. There were quite a few new terms which i heard about. Some of them are : <br> 1) Internal and External Threats posed to a company <br> 2) Technical Skills which are skills used solely for one field, some of these skills include Programming Languages like Python, MySQL, SIEM Tools. <br> 3) Transferable Skills which are skills that can be used in various other fields, some of these skills could be Communication, Event Management, Problem Solving. <br> 4) The difference between PII (Personally Identifiabale Information) and SPII (Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information) and the different threats one can face when they get accidentally leaked.
- This course seems to be fun and i hope to learn much more, there are 3 more modules left until the ending of course 1 of this Google Profesional Certificate

### ❓ Questions or Confusions
- Still didn't understand the importance of SIEM Tools
- The actual amount of threats posed when a SPII gets leaked
