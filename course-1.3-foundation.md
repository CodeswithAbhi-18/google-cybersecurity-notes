🗓️ Completed: 28th June, 2025

### 🧠 Key Concepts
- Frameworks and Controls 
- Ethics in Cybersecurity

### 💡 Personal Understanding 
- This speciific segment taught me about the definition of security frameworks and control, the CIA triad which includes Confidentiality, Availability and Integrity and how a security analyst works according to them. <br> It also taught us about the various laws which exist in the world and how the hacktivists don't follow these rules. It also taught us about the NIST CyberSecurity Framework. Then we learned the Ethics amd various dilemna faced by the workers when exposed to real world problems and how they must continuously follow their work ethics before any personal ethics. The importance of counterattacks was also taught and how only a few specific type of people can initiate counterattacks in the US. This segment was a bit lengthy and heavily theory based which could possibly strike a certain disinterest in the person studying but i hope that the course will become more practical based as well.
- This course is nearing its end and i hope that the knowledge i gained here can help me in the real world, there is only 1 more module left until the ending of course 1 of this Google Profesional Certificate

### ❓ Questions or Confusions
- Why exactly can people not launch counterattacks especially if their own personal data is at risk?
- How can someone follow the Ethics of cybersecurity even if one's job is at risk?
